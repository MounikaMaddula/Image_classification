Image classification modules in pytorch

Dataset can be downloaded from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/slothkong/10-monkey-species


Model file contains VGG architecture code to train the model from scratch


In main.py, we have trained the model from scracth and achieved an accuracy of 45%. We have also tried transfer learning on this dataset by taking various pretrained models, freezing their convolution layers and training the fully connected layers.These models achieved an accuracy of 99%
